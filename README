ROPScan v1.0
============

Motivation
----------

Return-oriented programming is a technique that relies on opcode sequences
ending in a RET instruction and that are available from library or binary
code within an application's address space. These sequences are therefore
available in executable code pages and may be executed even if the underlying
OS/HW supports non-executable page rights.

For details on these attacks read:

To initiate ROP, one needs a database of RET sequences. ROPScan supports
deriving such a database by scanning executable sequences of a binary/library
and checking the sequence's disassembly for being a valid and useful RET
sequence.


Usage
-----
rc.py scan <options> <file>

Options:
- - - - -

--dump=[yes|no]    Dump found sequences. Default: yes
--numbytes=<num>   Number of bytes a sequence may at most contain.
                   Default: 20
